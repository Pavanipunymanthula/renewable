# Documentation of the weather data csv files

## the_big_one.csv

The ```the_big_one.csv``` file displays all the information for data types we chose were relevant for the project for all the stations that have published data for all 2022.

### rows

each row represents a hour of the year 2022

### date column

day, in date format `yyyymmdd`

### hour column
hour of the day, when the data was gathered in `24 hour` format

### All other columns

these are all the stations data grouped by *sub-data types*.\
The columns are named `XXXXX/YY-I` where

``XXXXX`` is the station-ID the data was gathered from\
``YY`` is the abbreviation for the type of data\
``I`` is the subtype of data

_A list to specify the abbreviations and sub-types in form `YY-I`:_
```
TU-0    air temperature in Â°C

TU-1    moisture in %

N-0     cloudiness in 1/8 parts of the sky

RR-0    hourly downfall in mm

RR-1    indicator of downfall in numerical binary code

RR-2    type of downfall in numerical code

SD-0    sunshine per hour in min

VV-0    visibility in m

FF-0    wind speed in m/sec

FF-1    wind direction in degrees from north
```

The file contains columns, where the station didn't measure a single piece of data. The columns were created for the sake of completeness of our data. Therefore for use in our project it likely has to be further curated!
